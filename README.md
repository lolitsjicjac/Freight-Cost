Niagara case study showing how Q1 sales turned out

## Purpose of Case Study
We would like to see how our Q1 data has broken down in the past three months.
By breaking up out data in the differernt cities and customers that are purchasing our products we can see who is purchasing the largest amount from us. The data is broken down to show how each city percentage of bought cases is shown to give a good view at which locations are purchasing the most. We have also show a box plot of price of shipment broken down into the different cities to show which cities are costing the most and which one the least. We also see if there is any correlation between different states and a 24 pack equivalents we have. (We did not account which type of products the customers bought, so by using the 24 equivalents we can generalize the different products.) So we can now see which states have the strongest correlation between items. With this information we can make informed decision in the future as to optimize which location should receive a specific type since they will consume the most of it and so forth.
